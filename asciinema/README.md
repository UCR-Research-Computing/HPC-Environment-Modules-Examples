Installed manually to avoid setting up a new env. Tool is available https://asciinema.org/ and via github https://asciinema.org/docs/installation.
I created a bin/asciinema file which manually forces the PYTHONPATH to the installed directory to make this work as standalone.
It depends on python3 so I required miniconda3 loaded.
