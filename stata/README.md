# Install
Ask ITS for a download link and download the "Legacy" version.
CentOS has issues with missing libraries if you get the normal version.
Once the tar is downloaded, `Stata16Linux64-Legacy.tar.gz`, extract it.
Once extracted, then use the `stinit` script to create a new license.
You will need to get these from a PDF license provided by ITS.
