This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) - https://github.com/chaoszhang/A-pro

ASTRAL-pro extends ASTRAL to allow multi-copy genes. ASTRAL-pro finds the species tree that has the maximum number of shared induced quartet tree equivalent classes with the set of gene trees, subject to the constraint that the set of bipartitions in the species tree comes from a predefined set of bipartitions. ASTRAL-pro code is based on ASTRAL-MP.
