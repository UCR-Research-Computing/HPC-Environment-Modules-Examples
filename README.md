# Installing Software
This will obviously need to be expanded.

However you can look at the openbabel module and see the example README.md:
[Openbabel](openbabel "openbabel")

## Installs
TODO

## Modules
These are the modules that are currently available on biocluster

Module files now use environment variables to determine the path:
    IIGB_MODULES - Path dynamically built by /etc/profile.d/modules.sh at login to specify install path of modules.
    MODULESHOME - Path set by module system to specify home of module system.
